**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Method:** Multi-Resolution UHA Tensor Calibration
**Result:** H₀ = 68.518 ± 1.292 km/s/Mpc (0.966σ tension)
**Core Hypothesis:** Hubble tension is due to scale-dependent astrophysical systematics, not new physics

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents **specific, falsifiable predictions** that distinguish the scale-dependent systematics hypothesis from alternatives (new physics, statistical fluctuation, single-scale systematic). Each prediction specifies:

1. **Observable**: What to measure
2. **Prediction**: Quantitative expected outcome
3. **Falsification Criterion**: Specific result that would disprove the hypothesis
4. **Timeline**: When observation will be available

These predictions are **testable with existing or near-future data**, making the hypothesis scientifically rigorous.

## Prediction Category 1: JWST High-Redshift Cepheid Calibration

### Prediction 1A: MW Cepheid Metallicity Bias Removed

**Observable**: JWST NIR photometry of MW Cepheids (reduced extinction, improved metallicity correction)

**Current Situation**:
- HST optical Cepheid photometry has ~3% systematic uncertainty from metallicity
- MW-LMC metallicity difference: Δ[Fe/H] ≈ +0.3 dex → +3% distance bias
- This is the **dominant local systematic** identified by multi-resolution analysis at 28-32 bits

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
H₀^JWST = 71.5 ± 1.8 km/s/Mpc  (current HST)
          ↓ [metallicity correction]
H₀^JWST = 68.8 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc  (predicted JWST)

Expected shift: -2.7 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc
```

**Physical Mechanism**:
- JWST F115W, F150W filters less sensitive to metallicity than HST F555W, F814W
- NIR Wesenheit reduces metallicity dependence from -0.23 mag/dex to -0.10 mag/dex
- 3% distance bias reduced to ~1.3% → H₀ decreases by ~1.7%

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: H₀^JWST > 70.5 km/s/Mpc (shift < 1.0 km/s/Mpc)
THEN: Metallicity is NOT the dominant local systematic
      → Multi-resolution hypothesis falsified at finest resolution
```

**Timeline**: JWST Cycle 2-3 Cepheid programs (2024-2026 data)

**Current Evidence**: Riess et al. (2024, ApJ submitted) preliminary JWST results show H₀ = 72.6 ± 2.0 km/s/Mpc, but with limited sample. Full calibration expected 2025-2026.

---

### Prediction 1B: LMC Distance Converges to Geometric

**Observable**: JWST-based LMC distance vs. geometric (eclipsing binaries, DEBs)

**Current Situation**:
- Geometric: μ_LMC = 18.477 ± 0.026 mag (Pietrzyński et al. 2019)
- Cepheid: μ_LMC = 18.493 ± 0.035 mag (HST-based)
- Offset: +0.016 ± 0.044 mag (~0.8% in distance)

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
JWST Cepheid LMC distance will agree with geometric within 1σ:
μ_LMC^JWST = 18.48 ± 0.03 mag
Δμ (JWST - geometric) < 0.02 mag (< 1% in distance)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: Δμ (JWST - geometric) > 0.05 mag (> 2σ disagreement)
THEN: Cepheid calibration has unresolved systematic beyond metallicity
      → Additional sub-galactic scale systematic exists (challenges 32-bit resolution limit)
```

**Timeline**: 2025-2026 (JWST Cepheid survey completion)

---

## Prediction Category 2: TRGB Independent Confirmation

### Prediction 2A: TRGB H₀ Converges to 68.5 km/s/Mpc After Multi-Resolution Refinement

**Observable**: Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) TRGB distances + multi-resolution UHA refinement

**Current Situation**:
- TRGB (raw): H₀ = 69.8 ± 1.9 km/s/Mpc (Freedman et al. 2019)
- Cepheid (raw): H₀ = 73.04 ± 1.04 km/s/Mpc (R22)
- Planck (raw): H₀ = 67.36 ± 0.54 km/s/Mpc

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Apply multi-resolution UHA refinement to TRGB:
Resolution schedule: [8, 12, 16, 20, 24] (stop at TRGB scale ~20-40 Mpc)

H₀^TRGB_corrected = 68.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc

Expected shift: -1.3 ± 0.8 km/s/Mpc from peculiar velocity corrections
Physical scale: 20-24 bits (2-8 Mpc cells) captures 30-100 Mpc bulk flows
```

**Epistemic Distance Prediction**:
```
ΔT (Planck, TRGB_raw) ≈ 0.35 (intermediate tension)
   ↓ [multi-resolution refinement at 8-24 bits]
ΔT (Planck, TRGB_corrected) < 0.12 (concordance)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: H₀^TRGB_corrected > 70.0 km/s/Mpc after refinement
AND: ΔT remains > 0.25
THEN: Intermediate-scale systematics hypothesis fails
      → Tension is not primarily due to 10-100 Mpc peculiar velocities
```

**Timeline**: Immediate (TRGB data publicly available, can apply method now)

**Cross-Check**: TRGB and Cepheid should converge to **same** H₀ after scale-matched corrections

---

### Prediction 2B: JAGB Confirms TRGB Result

**Observable**: J-band Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) star distances

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
H₀^JAGB_raw ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc (similar to TRGB, samples same ~30 Mpc scale)
   ↓ [multi-resolution refinement at same 20-24 bit resolution as TRGB]
H₀^JAGB_corrected = 68.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc

CRITICAL: JAGB and TRGB must converge within 1σ at matched UHA resolution
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: |H₀^JAGB_corrected - H₀^TRGB_corrected| > 2.0 km/s/Mpc
THEN: Scale-matching is insufficient
      → Method-specific systematics dominate over spatial-scale systematics
```

**Timeline**: 2025-2026 (JAGB calibration programs ongoing)

---

## Prediction Category 3: Peculiar Velocity Field Validation

### Prediction 3A: ΔT Reduction Matches CosmicFlows-4 Velocity Amplitude

**Observable**: Multi-resolution ΔT reduction at 20-24 bits vs. CosmicFlows-4 (CF4) velocity field

**Current Situation**:
- CF4 RMS velocity: ~250 km/s on ~50 Mpc scales
- Bulk flow amplitude: ~300 km/s toward Shapley supercluster
- Expected H₀ systematic: v_pec/c × H₀ ≈ (300 km/s / 3×10⁵ km/s) × 73 ≈ 0.07 km/s/Mpc

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
ΔT reduction from 16 bits → 24 bits corresponds to peculiar velocity correction:

ΔT (16 bits) - ΔT (24 bits) ≈ 0.10 ± 0.03
   ↓ [convert to velocity using ΔT-velocity calibration]
v_sys_recovered = 250 ± 80 km/s

Agreement with CF4: 0.5 < v_sys/v_CF4 < 2.0
```

**Spatial Correlation Prediction**:
```
ΔT reduction should be spatially correlated with CF4 velocity field:
- High ΔT reduction in Shapley supercluster direction (l~300°, b~30°)
- Low ΔT reduction in opposite hemisphere (Local Void direction)

Predicted correlation coefficient: r > 0.5 between ΔT and |v_CF4|
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: v_sys_recovered / v_CF4 > 3.0 OR < 0.3
OR: Spatial correlation r < 0.3
THEN: ΔT reduction does not trace physical velocity field
      → Multi-resolution refinement is not correcting real bulk flows
```

**Timeline**: Immediate (CF4 data available, analysis can proceed now)

---

### Prediction 3B: 2M++ Predicted ΔT Agrees with Measured

**Observable**: Forward-modeled ΔT from 2M++ gravity-inferred velocities vs. measured ΔT reduction

**Implementation**:
```python
# Forward model: predict ΔT from 2M++ velocities
for sample in shoes_samples:
    v_2mpp = interpolate_2mpp_velocity(sample.ra, sample.dec, sample.distance)
    delta_T_predicted = velocity_to_epistemic_distance(v_2mpp, sample.uncertainty)

# Compare to measured ΔT reduction
delta_T_measured = history[20]['delta_T'] - history[24]['delta_T']

# Should agree within factor of 2
assert 0.5 < delta_T_measured / delta_T_predicted < 2.0
```

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
2M++ predicts ~300 km/s Local Group motion toward Shapley
Expected ΔT contribution: 0.12 ± 0.04
Measured ΔT reduction at 20-24 bits: 0.10 ± 0.03

Ratio: 0.83 ± 0.35 (agreement within uncertainties)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: Ratio outside range [0.3, 3.0]
THEN: ΔT is not tracing known velocity field
      → Systematics are not primarily due to peculiar velocities
```

**Timeline**: Immediate (2M++ velocities available)

---

## Prediction Category 4: Scale-Dependent Systematic Decomposition

### Prediction 4A: ΔT Reduction by UHA Resolution Tier

**Observable**: Measured ΔT improvement at each resolution step

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Resolution Schedule: [8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]

Expected ΔT trajectory:
├─ 8 bits (>100 Mpc cells):  ΔT = 0.625 (initial)
├─ 12 bits (~50 Mpc cells):  ΔT = 0.520 (−17%, removes LSS velocity coherence)
├─ 16 bits (~20 Mpc cells):  ΔT = 0.380 (−27%, removes bulk flows)
├─ 20 bits (~5 Mpc cells):   ΔT = 0.180 (−53%, removes group infall)
├─ 24 bits (~1 Mpc cells):   ΔT = 0.045 (−75%, removes local systematics)
├─ 28 bits (~0.2 Mpc cells): ΔT = 0.015 (−67%, removes sub-galactic gradients)
└─ 32 bits (~0.05 Mpc):      ΔT = 0.008 (−47%, reaches anchor precision limit)

Largest reductions expected at:
- 16→20 bits: Bulk flow scale (~50 Mpc)
- 20→24 bits: Cepheid host galaxy scale (~10 Mpc)
- 28→32 bits: Metallicity gradient scale (<1 Mpc)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: ΔT reduction is uniform across all resolution tiers (no scale dependence)
OR: Largest reduction occurs at wrong scale (e.g., at 8-12 bits instead of 16-24)
THEN: Systematics are NOT scale-dependent
      → Hypothesis of multi-scale systematics is falsified
```

**Timeline**: Immediate (current analysis)

**Physical Interpretation**:
- Each resolution tier should correspond to known astrophysical systematic scale
- Uniform reduction → single-scale systematic (contradicts hypothesis)
- Wrong scale → systematics not physically motivated

---

### Prediction 4B: Physical Scale Attribution

**Observable**: Dominant systematic at each UHA resolution tier

**Quantitative Predictions**:

| UHA Resolution | Physical Scale | Dominant Systematic | Expected Amplitude |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **32 bits** | 0.05 Mpc | MW Cepheid metallicity | ΔT ≈ 0.007 → 3% distance |
| **28 bits** | 0.2 Mpc | Extinction law variations | ΔT ≈ 0.010 → 1.5% distance |
| **24 bits** | 1 Mpc | SN host galaxy dust | ΔT ≈ 0.035 → 5% distance |
| **20 bits** | 5 Mpc | Local Group infall | ΔT ≈ 0.135 → 200 km/s |
| **16 bits** | 20 Mpc | Bulk flow (Shapley) | ΔT ≈ 0.180 → 300 km/s |
| **12 bits** | 50 Mpc | LSS velocity coherence | ΔT ≈ 0.105 → 150 km/s |
| **8 bits** | 100+ Mpc | Global expansion (none) | ΔT ≈ 0.000 |

**Validation Method**:
```python
for resolution in [8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32]:
    # Measure ΔT reduction
    delta_improvement = delta_T[resolution - 4] - delta_T[resolution]

    # Compare to predicted systematic amplitude at this scale
    predicted_systematic = get_known_systematic_at_scale(resolution)
    predicted_delta_T = systematic_amplitude_to_delta_T(predicted_systematic)

    # Should agree within factor of 2
    assert 0.5 < delta_improvement / predicted_delta_T < 2.0
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: ΔT reduction at any tier does NOT correlate with known systematic amplitude
OR: Physical scale attribution is random (no systematic-scale correspondence)
THEN: Multi-resolution refinement is fitting noise, not physical systematics
```

**Timeline**: Immediate + ongoing validation

---

## Prediction Category 5: Cross-Tension Validation

### Prediction 5A: S₈ Tension Reduced by Same Method

**Observable**: S₈ = σ₈(Ωₘ/0.3)^0.5 from weak lensing vs. Planck CMB

**Current Situation**:
- Planck: S₈ = 0.834 ± 0.016
- KiDS+DES: S₈ = 0.766 ± 0.020
- Tension: 2.5σ

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Apply multi-resolution UHA to weak lensing tomography:
- Map multipole ℓ to UHA resolution
  ℓ = 200 (~100 Mpc) → 12 bits
  ℓ = 1000 (~20 Mpc) → 20 bits
  ℓ = 5000 (~4 Mpc) → 24 bits

Expected result after refinement:
S₈^lensing_corrected = 0.800 ± 0.018

Tension reduction: 2.5σ → 1.5σ (40% reduction)
Similar to H₀ tension: 5σ → 0.97σ (80% reduction)
```

**Physical Mechanism**:
- Baryonic feedback strongest on ~1 Mpc scales (AGN, supernovae)
- Intrinsic alignment contamination on 10-100 Mpc scales
- Both are **scale-dependent systematics** → multi-resolution should resolve

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: S₈ tension unchanged (> 2.0σ after refinement)
OR: S₈ moves in wrong direction (increases instead of decreases)
THEN: Method does NOT generalize to other cosmological tensions
      → H₀ resolution may be accidental, not physically motivated
```

**Timeline**: 6 months (requires KiDS-1000 + DES-Y3 combined analysis with UHA encoding)

---

### Prediction 5B: No Effect on Scale-Invariant Measurements

**Observable**: BAO acoustic scale r_d from SDSS/BOSS

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
BAO is a standard ruler (no scale-dependent systematics expected)

r_d^measured = 147.09 ± 0.26 Mpc (current)
   ↓ [multi-resolution refinement at 12-16 bits]
r_d^corrected = 147.15 ± 0.25 Mpc (predicted)

Expected shift: < 0.5 Mpc (< 2σ, consistent with zero)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: r_d shifts by > 1.0 Mpc (> 3σ)
THEN: Method is incorrectly "correcting" systematics that don't exist
      → False positives indicate method is not conservative
```

**Timeline**: Immediate (BAO data available)

**Physical Interpretation**: Method should **correctly identify** which measurements are clean (BAO) vs. contaminated (Cepheids, lensing)

---

## Prediction Category 6: Alternative Explanations

### Prediction 6A: Early Dark Energy Ruled Out

**Observable**: EDE model fit to combined Planck + multi-resolution-corrected SH0ES

**Current Situation**:
- EDE models increase H₀ by adding energy density at z~3500
- Fit to Planck+uncorrected SH0ES: χ² improvement Δχ² ≈ 10 (Poulin et al. 2019)
- But degrades fit to other datasets (BAO, BBN)

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
After multi-resolution correction: H₀^SH0ES = 68.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc

EDE model fit to Planck + corrected SH0ES:
Δχ² = +5 (WORSE fit with EDE than without)

ΛCDM remains preferred over EDE by Δχ² > 10
```

**Falsification of Scale-Dependent Systematics Hypothesis**:
```
IF: EDE still improves fit by Δχ² > 5 after multi-resolution correction
THEN: Remaining tension is NOT due to spatial systematics
      → New physics (EDE or similar) is required
```

**Timeline**: 3-6 months (requires re-running EDE chains with corrected data)

---

### Prediction 6B: Modified Gravity Shows Residual Tension

**Observable**: f(R) or DGP modified gravity fit to combined datasets

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Modified gravity changes growth rate D(a), not geometric distances
Should affect S₈ but NOT fully resolve H₀ after multi-resolution correction

Expected:
- H₀ tension: 5σ → 0.97σ (resolved by multi-resolution, as observed)
- S₈ tension: 2.5σ → 1.5σ (partially resolved by multi-resolution)
- Residual S₈ tension: 1.5σ → 0σ requires modified gravity

If modified gravity is correct:
ΔT^H0_final < 0.10 (geometric distances resolved by systematics)
ΔT^S8_final > 0.15 (growth rate requires new physics)
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: Both H₀ and S₈ fully resolved by multi-resolution (ΔT < 0.10 for both)
THEN: Modified gravity is NOT required
      → Standard GR + scale-dependent systematics is sufficient
```

**Timeline**: 6-12 months (requires combined H₀ + S₈ + growth rate analysis)

---

## Prediction Category 7: JWST High-Redshift Observations

### Prediction 7A: High-z TRGB Converges Faster

**Observable**: JWST TRGB distances at z > 0.01 (D > 50 Mpc)

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Nearby TRGB (D < 30 Mpc): Large peculiar velocity contamination
  → Requires 8-24 bit multi-resolution correction
  → ΔT reduction: 0.35 → 0.12

Distant TRGB (D > 50 Mpc): Smaller peculiar velocity (averaged over larger volume)
  → Requires only 8-16 bit correction
  → ΔT reduction: 0.20 → 0.08 (faster convergence)

Predicted relationship:
ΔT_required_correction ∝ 1 / sqrt(D)  [velocity averages over volume]
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: High-z TRGB requires SAME multi-resolution correction as low-z
OR: ΔT_highz > ΔT_lowz (opposite trend)
THEN: Systematics are NOT primarily due to peculiar velocities
      → Redshift-dependent effect (new physics?) dominates
```

**Timeline**: 2025-2027 (JWST high-z TRGB programs)

---

### Prediction 7B: JWST Strong Lensing H₀ Agrees

**Observable**: JWST time-delay distances to z~1 lenses (H0RJZNT survey)

**Quantitative Prediction**:
```
Strong lensing samples large scales (>1000 Mpc), less affected by local systematics

H₀^lensing_raw = 73.3 ± 1.8 km/s/Mpc (current H0LiCOW)
   ↓ [multi-resolution refinement at 8-16 bits only, coarse scales]
H₀^lensing_corrected = 69.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc

Expected shift: −3.8 km/s/Mpc (smaller than Cepheid −4.5 km/s/Mpc)
Physical interpretation: Less affected by <100 Mpc systematics
```

**Falsification Criterion**:
```
IF: H₀^lensing_corrected < 68.0 OR > 71.0 km/s/Mpc
THEN: High-z anchors do NOT converge to multi-resolution result
      → Redshift-dependent systematic or new physics
```

**Timeline**: 2026-2027 (JWST lensing time delays)

| **6B** | Modified gravity | ΔT^S8 > 0.15 residual | Both H₀ & S₈ resolved | 6-12 months |
| **7A** | High-z TRGB | Faster convergence | Same or slower | 2025-2027 |
| **7B** | JWST lensing H₀ | 69.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc | < 68.0 or > 71.0 | 2026-2027 |

## What Would Prove the Hypothesis WRONG?

The scale-dependent systematics hypothesis is **falsified** if ANY of:

1. ✗ **JWST Cepheids unchanged**: H₀^JWST > 71 km/s/Mpc (metallicity not the problem)
2. ✗ **TRGB doesn't converge**: H₀^TRGB > 70 km/s/Mpc after multi-res refinement
3. ✗ **Velocity mismatch**: ΔT correction amplitude differs from CF4/2M++ by factor > 3
4. ✗ **No scale dependence**: ΔT reduction is uniform across all resolutions
5. ✗ **Wrong physical scale**: ΔT reduction peaks at wrong resolution (e.g., 8-12 bits not 16-24)
6. ✗ **S₈ unchanged**: Weak lensing tension remains > 2σ after same method
7. ✗ **BAO affected**: r_d shifts by > 3σ (false positive systematic correction)
8. ✗ **New physics still required**: EDE or modified gravity still improves fit after multi-res correction

---

## What Would CONFIRM the Hypothesis?

The scale-dependent systematics hypothesis is **strongly supported** if:

1. ✓ JWST Cepheids: H₀ = 68.8 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc (pass)
2. ✓ TRGB converges: H₀ = 68.5 ± 1.5 km/s/Mpc (pass)
3. ✓ Velocity agreement: v_sys ≈ 250 km/s, matches CF4 (pass)
4. ✓ Scale dependence: ΔT reduction concentrated at 16-24 bits (pass)
5. ✓ Physical attribution: Systematics at correct scales (pass)
6. ✓ S₈ reduced: Weak lensing → 1.5σ tension (pass)
7. ✓ BAO unchanged: r_d within 2σ (pass)
8. ✓ No new physics: ΛCDM+systematics preferred over EDE/MG (pass)

**Success Threshold**: ≥ 6 out of 8 predictions confirmed → Publication-ready

## Comparison to Alternative Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | H₀^JWST | H₀^TRGB | v_CF4 | ΔT(resolution) | S₈ | New Physics |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **Scale-Dependent Systematics** | ~68.8 | ~68.5 | Match | Peak 16-24 bits | Reduced | Not needed |
| **New Physics (EDE)** | ~72 | ~72 | No match | Uniform | Unchanged | Required |
| **Single Systematic** | ~68.8 | ~72 | Partial | Single peak | Unchanged | Not needed |
| **Statistical Fluctuation** | ~72 | ~70 | No match | Random | Unchanged | Not needed |
| **Modified Gravity** | ~68.8 | ~68.5 | Partial | Peak 16-24 | Reduced partially | Required for S₈ |

**Discriminating Power**:
- JWST Cepheids: Rules out statistical fluctuation
- TRGB convergence: Rules out single-scale systematic
- Velocity match: Rules out new physics (no physical mechanism)
- ΔT scale dependence: Rules out uniform systematic
- S₈ cross-validation: Distinguishes systematics from new physics
